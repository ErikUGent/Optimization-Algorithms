This repository contains the algorithms and test files used, mdified or created by Erik De Kuyffer in the context of his PhD at the University of Ghent.

In the first project (3 Island Model), Genetic Algorithms are used on a multi-objective island model to optimize simultaneously the distance traveled, the energy required and the lateness of the maintenance planning of offshore windmills. Threedimensional Pareto points are calculated and plotted, each representing a sequence of windmills to be maintained.

The second project contains three comparison methods for solving VRPTW, used in planning optimization for offshore windmill maintenance. It further contains an algorithm to solve the Job Shop Scheduling Problem and the calculation of twodimensional Pareto points to apply both optimization methods (VRPTW and JSSP) simultaneously.
