This repository contains the algorithms and test files used, mdified or created by Erik De Kuyffer in the context of his PhD at the University of Ghent.

In the first project (3 Island Model), Genetic Algorithms are used on a multi-objective island model to optimize simultaneously the distance traveled, the energy required and the lateness of the maintenance planning of offshore windmills.
